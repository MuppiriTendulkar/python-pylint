pylint:

    code linter is a program that inspects the python code, and give feedback on your pythoncode and also it will tell you how to resolve this.

when you execute pylint <filename>, you will get/see the following type of errors

    C:(convention/code style) for programming standard violation
    R:(refactor) for bad code smell
    W:(warning)  for python specific problems
    E:(error) for much probably bugs in the code
    F:(fatal) if an error occurred which prevented pylint from doing further processing.

  --> wrong import postion(In python, the modules should be placed in begining of the program)
  --> bad-whitespace
      example:
              (a=10)
  -->missing-function-docstring
      example: """ ..........................."""
        the above represents the docstring, in below every function there should be a docstring
  -->bad-continuation(there should not be any spaces)
      example:
        sg_client = boto3.client('ec2', aws_access_key_id=credentials['AccessKeyId'],
                                    aws_secret_access_key=credentials['SecretAccessKey'],
                                    aws_session_token=credentials['SessionToken']
                                )
        sg_client = boto3.client('ec2', aws_access_key_id=credentials['AccessKeyId'],aws_secret_access_key=credentials['SecretAccessKey'],aws_session_token=credentials['SessionToken'])
